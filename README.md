This project is an intelligent and customizable chatbot designed to assist users in researching historical events, news, and factual information with high accuracy and verified sources. The main goal of the system is to deliver clear, reliable responses while automatically providing their corresponding references — saving time, improving trust, and reducing operational costs.

The assistant aims to solve a common problem found in many conversational AI tools: users often need to ask follow-up questions to confirm the origin of the information they receive. By integrating automatic source attribution into every factual answer, this chatbot streamlines the research process and eliminates the need for redundant prompts.

## Key Features

- **Source-Verified Responses**  
  The assistant automatically appends sources to factual answers, ensuring clarity, transparency, and faster validation.

- **Backend-Driven Customization**  
  The assistant's personality, tone, and behavioral rules can be fully customized via the `AGENT_BEHAVIOR` variable inside the Flask backend.  
  This allows developers to adjust how the assistant speaks, how formal or creative it is, and how it handles facts and citations — without modifying the front-end or retraining the model.

- **Optimized Prompt Usage**  
  Because the assistant automatically provides verified sources, users no longer need extra prompts to request references.  
  This reduces the number of API calls and helps organizations lower monthly operational costs.

- **Research-Oriented Design**  
  Ideal for historical data lookups, news verification, academic projects, and professional research workflows.
